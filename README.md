# NHXHide
Repository for Source code of NHXHide, a data in image encoding module.

Using this tool is as simplistic as possible, you will be guided by tool itself.

Installation of Python version 3 or greater is a prerequisite.

If using on Linux, I recommend running setup.sh script to make sure that you can access the tool from any directory you want, by just typing, "NHXHide".

*When passed the optional argument, the data is extracted or penetrated from the data file provided (Large Files Supported!).

Windows users just access the tool via the Python shell.

Happy Data Penetration!
